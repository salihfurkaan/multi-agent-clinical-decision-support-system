Hi [patient_information.name], based on your hypertension and type 2 diabetes, we recommend blood pressure monitoring and lipid management. If confirmed, MRI or CT scan may be needed to evaluate for stroke or heart attack. This should help with your symptoms. We are watching closely for any changes, especially considering your family history of stroke and heart disease. Medications like Orlistat mesilate (to manage weight) and Amlodipine (for blood pressure) will help control your conditions. Avoiding high sodium and saturated foods is key. Next steps include regular follow-ups and lifestyle changes. This is routine care.
